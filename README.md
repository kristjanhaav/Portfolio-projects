# Message Generator Program

## Overview
The Message Generator Program is a JavaScript-based application that generates a new, randomized message each time it is run. These messages can take various forms, including:
- **Astrology-based predictions**
- **Inspirational quotes**
- **Nonsensical jokes**

Each message is composed of at least three pieces of randomized data, ensuring a unique output on every execution.

## Project Objectives
- **Develop a Random Message Generator:** Build a functional JavaScript program that generates randomized messages.
- **Utilize Version Control:** Employ Git for managing the source code.
- **Command Line Development:** Use command line tools for development and execution.
- **Local Development:** Develop and test the application locally before any potential deployment.

## Methodology: Agile (Kanban)
This project adopts an Agile methodology using a Kanban approach. The workflow on the Kanban board is structured as follows:
- **Backlog (To Do)**
- **Selected for Work**
- **In Progress (Ongoing Development)**
- **Review (Code Review, Testing)**
- **Done (Completed and Merged to Main Branch)**
